# Frog Pond Archipelago Manual
A Manual Randomizer for Frog Pond, for use with the [Archipelago Manual Project](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago).
## About the Game
[Frog Pond](https://sharyap.itch.io/frog-pond) is a desktop idle game by shar. It is available on itch.io for your named price. While you can download it for free, please consider supporting the developer monetarily if you enjoy the game!

In Frog Pond, you set out a pot of flowers for frogs to enjoy when they visit your pond. The frogs will give you Shiny Stones,  which can be used to purchase decorations for your pond. Different decorations will attract different frogs.
## About the Manual
The goal of the manual is to meet all the frogs. This manual has locations for each frog in the game and all purchased decor. You'll receive Progressive Decor Slots and random Decor Sets that will determine what items you can purchase. Each Progressive Decor Slot will unlock columns of items and the Decor sets will unlock rows. For example, to purchase the RGB Lights item, you will need 3 Progressive Decor Slots and the Arcade Set.

The manual's filler item is Shiny Stones. It is not expected that you manipulate the game in anyway to "cheat" in extra stones. You will receive plenty from the visiting frogs for the decor you unlock.

The game has information for what time of day a frog can appear and what decor they prefer. **Note:** There are two frogs that only appear during a single six hour window of time. If you are unable to play during this time due to sleep or life obligations, you can change the clock on your computer to the frog's preferred time block to have them visit. Please do not intentionally change your sleep schedule for this game!

Sometimes frogs will appear without all of their preferred items unlocked and on display in the pond. It is up to the player to decide if they will check the location "out of logic" or not.

Due to the RNG of frog visits and the time blocks, this manual is not recommended for syncs even with computer clock changes. This manual is intended to be a nice addition to an async, either as a low effort submission or alongside another game.
